## Problems Week 1 Day 2

Solve the problems! The problem is correct if each case prints out true.

```ruby
# Write a method times_by_three(arr) that takes an array and returns  
# a new array where each number is multiplied by 3.

def times_by_three(arr)
  # Put code here
end

puts times_by_three([1, 2, 3]) == [3, 6, 9]
puts times_by_three([2, 4, 6]) == [6, 12, 18]
puts times_by_three([100, 200, 300]) == [300, 600, 900]
puts times_by_three([1, 5, 10, 15]) == [3, 15, 30, 45]
```
