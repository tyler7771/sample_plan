## Week 2 Review

Solve the problems! The problem is correct if each case prints out true.

```ruby
# Write a method two_dimensional_count(arr) that returns how many numbers are in the 2D array.

def two_dimensional_count(arr)
  # Put code here
end

puts two_dimensional_sum([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == 5
puts two_dimensional_sum([[4, 2, 10], [7, 7, 4] [9]]) == 7
puts two_dimensional_sum([[10, 10, 10], [9, 16, 4, 32] [99, 4]]) == 9
```
