## Week 2 Review

Solve the problems! The problem is correct if each case prints out true.

```ruby
# Write a function `luckySevens(max)` that returns an array of all #numbers up to max (inclusive) that are divisible by 7.

def luckySevens(max)
  # Your code here
end

puts luckySevens(25) == [ 7, 14, 21 ]
puts luckySevens(42) == [ 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 ]
```
