## Problems Week 3 Day 4

Solve the problems! The problem is correct if each case prints out true.

```ruby
# Write a method sum(arr) that takes an Array and sums all the elements in the array. First right an iterative version and then a recursive version.

def sum(arr)
  # Put code here
end

puts sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 15
puts sum([4, 2, 10, 7, 7, 4, 9]) == 43
puts sum([ 10, 9, 16, 4, 32, 99, 4]) == 174
```
